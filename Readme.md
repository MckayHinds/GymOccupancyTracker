# Gym Occupancy Tracker

This site is a prototype tracker that will show roughly how many people are at the HART gym at a given time base on input from a motion sensor on the door as it only opens for one person at a time.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    1. Set up main website for the program to run on. Make sure it is appealing and stylized, as well as add some functional slides through Javascript

2. Backend: C#, API, C++, Json, platformio
    1. Create system "brain" with C# to create where input from the website, and the ESP32 code can be processed and sent back out. Initialize the API so that C# is able to talk with Frontend and Hardware. Json is used to translate messages between both ends/ create a key for the API so it is more secure, and C++ creates a place for the ESP32 C3 to run it's code from Arduino.

3. Hardware: ESP32 C3, Arduino, C
    1. Secure the ESP32 C3 as well as create C code in Arduino

Instructions for using the software:
